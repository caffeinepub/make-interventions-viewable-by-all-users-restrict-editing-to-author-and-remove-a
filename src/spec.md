# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Vial Traite Service branding, implement in-app document viewer with zoom capabilities, and enable folder management with drag-and-drop for technical folders and client interventions.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace application logo with Vial Traite Service logo
- Apply brand color palette (blue #0066CC, lime green #99CC33, orange #FF9933) throughout UI
- Implement in-app document viewer with zoom and image enlargement for technical folder documents
- Enable creation, renaming, and organization of subfolders within technical folder
- Add drag-and-drop functionality to move folders and files
- Extend technical folder support to all file formats (images, PDFs, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Apply same document viewer with zoom to client intervention files

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse documents with the new Vial Traite Service branded interface, view and zoom documents directly in the app, organize files into custom subfolders by theme, and drag-and-drop files between folders for both technical documents and client intervention files.
