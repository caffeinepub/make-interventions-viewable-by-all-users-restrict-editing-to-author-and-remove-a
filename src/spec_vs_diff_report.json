  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all core requirements for moving files between technical folders. REQ-1 through REQ-5 are fully implemented with Move action buttons, folder selection dialog, backend Motoko move function, React Query mutation hook, and automatic list refresh. However, one acceptance criterion for REQ-2 regarding nested folder navigation appears incomplete or simplified, as the dialog appears to use a flat breadcrumb approach rather than true hierarchical navigation with subfolder drill-down capability.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "User can navigate through nested folders (hierarchical navigation with drill-down)",
      "reason": "The MoveFolderDialog uses breadcrumb-based navigation and shows immediate subfolders at each level, but the diff shows simplified navigation logic that may not support full hierarchical traversal as implied by 'navigate through nested folders' in the acceptance criteria. The implementation shows folders as a flat list derived from file paths rather than a true nested tree structure with expandable/collapsible nodes.",
